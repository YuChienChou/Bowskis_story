                <h2>The Past</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Actually, I don't know much about Bowski's past.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I know from the foster is that he was taken to a shelter in San Francisco by his former owner in early April 2022 who claimed he couldn't keep Bowski because the place was too small after moving.
                </p>

                <p>
                    According to the adoption documents, I also learned that Bowski is a 4-year-old boy of mixed English and French bull dog and has been neutered. He was in good health and weighed about 40 pounds, but was being treated for an ear infection.

                <h2>First Time We Met</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    David had wanted to adopt a dog for some time. He has been browsing the websites of various shelters looking for puppies with first-sight attractions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On April 23, 2022, he scheduled two trips, first to see Bowski at a foster, then to the animal shelter in Vallejo to visit a French bulldog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the first stop, the foster family had already brought Bowski to greet us in the living room. As soon as I opened the door, I saw a small yellow-white ball rolling around excitedly, without any intention of stopping. You could tell he was quite happy. When I got a chance to catch a glimpse of his face, I instantly fell in love with the most ugly-cute little creature I've ever seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fifteen minutes later, as we brought Bowski to our car and ready to headed home, David said to me: "I still don't know what this dog's face looks like.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Now</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After introducing Bowski to meet our lovely cat, he officially became a member of our family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to his unique appearance, he also have interesting personality that cannot be ignored: he is very clingy, loves to cuddle, and e especially likes to be complimented by strangers. He is very timid, any small sound can scare him to death. He is brave when facing a working vacuum cleaner, though. Very obsessed with food, and more stubborn than any dog I've ever had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, his ear infection has healed, and the redness and swelling of his paws caused by allergies have been stably controlled with medication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since finding his forever home, he's  played out English bulldog's lazy nature. So far, the first time we met was the most agile I have seen him active. David and I will work our best to give him a happy and peaceful life.
