                    David and I took Bowski home from a foster on April 23, 2022. He was a 5-year old, English-Franchi mixed boy who was brought to the shelter in early 2022 by his previous owner.

                <p>
                    He came with infections in his ears and his front paws were swallen due to allergies. After some treatments, he is healthy and very playful.
